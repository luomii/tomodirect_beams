`CreateTomoDirectDose` reads in TomoDirect DQA per-beam binary doses and creates a DICOM RTDOSE file that can be opened by a DICOM viewer. The software can also adjust the IEC Y position to make the per beam DICOM RTDOSE files compatible with the ScandiDos Delta4 software, to allow per beam IMRT QA analysis of TomoDirect plans. The function requires the DICOM RTPLAN to generate the DICOM header and binary .img/.header files exported from the TomoTherapy DQA Software.

## Installation

To install the function as a MATLAB App, download and execute the `CreateTomoDirectDose.mlappinstall` file from this directory. If downloading the repository via git, make sure to download all submodules by running  `git clone --recursive https://github.com/mwgeurts/tomodirect_beams`.

## Usage and Documentation

This function can be executed without input arguments, upon which it will prompt the user to select the DICOM RTPLAN file and then the folder containing the binary dose files. The function will scan recursively through subfolders to identify all binary dose files. The per beam DICOM RTDOSE files will be written to the same folder as the selected DICOM RTPLAN file. 

Alternatively, the function can be executed with two inputs, the first the file name (full or relative to this function) of the DICOM RTPlan file and the second as the path to the binary folder. A flag to apply the beam isocenter offset can optionally be passed as a third input argument(`yes` or `no`).

Finally, if specified the written DICOM files will be returned as a cell array. Several examples are shown below:

```matlab
% Execute function with no inputs, storing the files  
files = CreateTomoDirectDose;

% Execute function with input arguments, not storing the result  
CreateTomoDirectDose('/path/rtplan.dcm', '/path/to/binary', 'yes');
```

## Compatibility and Requirements

This function has been validated for MATLAB version 8.5 on Macintosh OSX 10.10 (Yosemite). The function and its components use the Image Processing Toolbox MATLAB functions `dicominfo()` and `dicomwrite()` to read and write to the provided DICOM files.

## Troubleshooting

This application records key input parameters and results to a log.txt file using the `Event()` function. The log is the most important route to troubleshooting errors encountered by this software.
